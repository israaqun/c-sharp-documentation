# C# Documentation

Welcome to the C# Documentation website! This repository contains documentation for learning C# programming.

## Introduction

This documentation covers various aspects of C# programming, including syntax, data types, variables, type casting, user input, and booleans.

## Code Examples

Throughout this documentation, you'll find code examples that demonstrate various C# concepts. You can easily copy these examples to use in your own projects.

## Copying Code

To copy a code example:

1. Locate the code block you want to copy.
2. Click the "Copy" button next to the code block.

The code will be copied to your clipboard and can then be pasted into your code editor or development environment.

### Clipboard API

The Clipboard API is used to interact with the system clipboard, allowing you to programmatically copy and paste content. In this documentation, we use the Clipboard API to facilitate code copying.

### How It Works

1. When you click the "Copy" button next to a code example, JavaScript code behind the scenes uses the Clipboard API to copy the code to your clipboard.
2. You can then paste the copied code into your code editor.
